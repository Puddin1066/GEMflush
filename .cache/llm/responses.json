It was founded in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman. Initially, OpenAI started as a non-profit organization but later restructured into a \"capped-profit\" company in 2019. This change was made to enable OpenAI to raise the capital necessary to achieve its ambitious goals while still adhering to its original mission.\n\n### Background and Mission\n\nOpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity. The organization conducts research in the field of AI with the aim of promoting and developing friendly AI to prevent potential negative consequences of AI on society.\n\n### Research and Developments\n\nOpenAI is known for its significant contributions to the field of AI, including the development of advanced deep learning models and techniques. Some of its most notable projects include:\n\n1. **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Series**: Starting with GPT, OpenAI has released several iterations of this model, with GPT-3 being one of the most powerful language processing AI models ever created. These models are capable of generating human-like text and can perform a variety of language-based tasks.\n\n2. **DALL-E**: A model capable of generating images from textual descriptions, showcasing the ability of AI to understand and create visual content based on natural language inputs.\n\n3. **OpenAI Gym and Universe**: Platforms for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\n4. **OpenAI Five**: An AI system that played and competed at a high level in the complex multiplayer video game \"Dota 2.\"\n\n### Business Model and Partnerships\n\nIn 2019, OpenAI LP was formed as a capped-profit company to allow for the raising of investment while still aligning with its core mission of safe and widely distributed AGI. Microsoft has been a significant partner, providing OpenAI with computing resources and an investment of $1 billion to support OpenAI's projects.\n\n### Reputation in the Community\n\nOpenAI holds a strong reputation in both the AI research community and the broader tech industry for its cutting-edge research, ethical focus, and commitment to open sharing of knowledge (although it has sometimes withheld research, like the initial model of GPT-2, due to concerns about potential misuse). The organization actively engages with the AI policy and safety community to discuss the implications of AI and works towards developing secure and beneficial AI.\n\nHowever, OpenAI has also faced criticism, particularly regarding its decision to shift from a non-profit to a capped-profit model, which some see as a move away from its original ethos of total openness and non-profit operation. Additionally, the potential societal impacts of its powerful models, such as GPT-3, including concerns about misinformation, privacy, and job displacement, are subjects of ongoing debate.\n\nOverall, OpenAI is considered one of the leading organizations in the AI field, known for its innovative contributions and commitment to developing AI that is safe and beneficial for humanity.",
